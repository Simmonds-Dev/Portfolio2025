# Updated Portfolio for 2025

## Description

Thank you for making your way to the repository for my latest portfolio! I am still in the works of getting some things added, but I definitely wanted to push this to github pages to check on my responsiveness. 
I've moved this repository from my other Github account.
Your feedback is welcomed, so if you have any thoughts on my portfolio, or any of my other repositories, please let me know!
